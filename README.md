# DirectionsAPI
This is a comparison of the different directions API that use OpenStreetMap.

I will compare them to the google maps API and the mapbox API.

I will be using R principally and 3 different configurations : rural, suburban and urban to test the differences.

For all the test cases I will create 500 randomised points of origins and destinations.

All contributions are welcomed.
